Check if edit distance between two strings is one

An edit between two strings is one of the following changes. 

Add a character
Delete a character
Change a character
Given two string s1 and s2, find if s1 can be converted to s2 with exactly one edit. Expected time complexity is O(m+n) where m and n are lengths of two strings. 

function isEditDistanceOne(s1, s2)
    {
 
        // Find lengths of given strings
        let m = s1.length, n = s2.length;
 
        // If difference between lengths is
        // more than 1, then strings can't
        // be at one distance
        if (Math.abs(m - n) > 1)
            return false;
 
            // Count of edits
            let count = 0;
            let i = 0, j = 0;
 
        while (i < m && j < n)
        {
            // If current characters
            // don't match
            if (s1[i] != s2[j])
            {
                if (count == 1)
                    return false;
 
                // If length of one string is
                // more, then only possible edit
                // is to remove a character
                if (m > n)
                    i++;
                else if (m< n)
                    j++;
 
                 // If lengths of both
                 // strings is same
                else
                {
                    i++;
                    j++;
                }
 
                // Increment count of edits
                count++;
            }
 
            // If current characters match
            else
            {
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }
 
        // If last character is extra
        // in any string
        if (i < m || j < n)
            count++;
 
        return count <= 1;
    }
